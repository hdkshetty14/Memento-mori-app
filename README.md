# 🪦 Digital Memento Mori

> A minimalist, interactive reminder that your time is limited — built for digital minds.

This is a simple yet powerful web app inspired by the ancient Stoic practice of **Memento Mori** ("remember you must die"). It visualises the weeks of your life and shows a daily quote to nudge mindful living — made for those who spend their lives in front of screens.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Accepts your **birthdate** (for precise life tracking)
- Generates a **life calendar grid** (~4,160 weeks for 80 years):
  - 🟥 for weeks lived  
  - ⬜ for weeks remaining
- Shows a random **Memento Mori quote** every time you visit
- Provides a **daily reflection box** *(local only for now)*
